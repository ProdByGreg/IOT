### The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of physical objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies to connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the internet. These objects, also known as "smart objects", can include vehicles, appliances, and other things. IoT devices can communicate with each other and with the cloud.
